# Paper fidelity: repairs and remaining work

Updated 2026-11-12; the earlier rule audit used `popl27-paper152.pdf` and
`popl27-paper152-supplemental.pdf`, on Effekt v0.3.0.

The implementation is a tested subset of the algorithm, not a full transcription
of the paper language or an implementation covered automatically by its theorem.
This document distinguishes repaired acceptance bugs, surface conveniences, and
work that is still missing. This rule audit uses the supplied paper snapshots;
the maintained supplement now documents the Effekt implementation and its
current benchmark results.
For the suite outline and current per-family coverage, use
[BENCHMARKS.md](BENCHMARKS.md).

## Repaired checker discrepancies

| Audit item | Repair | Regression |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `A_Do` synthesized its argument instead of checking it | Operation arguments use `checkValue` against the operation domain, just like ordinary application | `operation-checked-lambda.effekt`: an inline identity function is accepted and returns 42 |
| Mixed pure/impure guarded join/meet lost the returned-value binder | Both initial answers are renamed into a fresh binder; the pure-to-impure premise has the appropriate returned-value type and branch assumption | `mixed-guard-dependent.effekt`, its mirrored branch order, and a weakened-precondition rejection |
| Extra capture-set subtyping rejected a recursive function under an unused handler | Captures no longer participate in function/scheme subtyping, type equality or free-region checking; the region still participates | `recursive-extra-capture.effekt` returns 42; a different region remains unequal |
| Type arguments had to be closed | Type arguments are resolved in the current context; instantiated types retain their region identities and remain subject to handler escape checks | A polymorphic identity can accept a local capability inside its handler; returning it out of that handler is rejected |
| Capability instantiation required identical signatures | `operationsSubtype` implements `S_Cap`: contravariant argument, covariant full dependent computation, including answer effects; capability-family parameters use the dual direction | A broader argument/stronger result is accepted; stronger preconditions and weaker postconditions are rejected |
| A capability binder did not scope over its operation signatures | Signature resolution introduces the fresh region first; equality also alpha-renames that region in signatures | A quantified operation's function parameter can refer to the bound region |
| Lambda domains were mandatory even in checking mode | `fun (x) { ... }` obtains its domain and codomain from an expected arrow | Ordinary checking machinery is exercised through operation arguments and handler returns; a wrong result is rejected |
| Handler result annotations were always mandatory | `try { ... } with h { ... }` is checked against an available expected computation type | Direct checking and a handler inside a region-polymorphic function; residuals are retained for abstraction |
| Unit refinements and universal formulas were missing | Added the singleton Unit logical sort/literal and scoped, sorted `forall` formulas; SMT uses a singleton datatype and quantifiers | Valid/invalid formulas, sort errors, binder shadowing and alpha-equivalence |

The three original reproduction files are in `examples/atm/fidelity/`.
`AtmFidelityTests` runs accepted executable cases against the independent source
interpreter and direct Chez-Lift with cleanup both enabled and disabled. Negative
cases must fail checking. The pre-fix run demonstrated that all three original
regressions failed; the repaired tests pass.

## Core validation strengthened, but not completed

`Core.validate` now tracks lexical value bindings and capability contracts. It
checks erased variable types, literal types, abstraction contracts, residual
telescopes, type-application results and freshness of region/evidence binders.
An operation's witness must end at its receiver's actual region, including when
the receiver is a capability alias. Checking only depth was insufficient to
detect a changed receiver.

Mutation tests now reject an operation redirected to another in-scope handler,
an unbound value and a changed base type on a bound variable. Earlier tests for
wrong regions, ATC depth, Lifted evidence and handler structure remain.

This is still **not a complete independent declarative checker**. Refinement
entailments, dependent computation subtyping and the ATC hole obligation remain
trusted results of `Checker`. In particular, successful structural validation is
not evidence for all of Theorem 3's typing premises.

## Implemented surface conveniences

The frontend retains the region-free Effekt-like surface. Explicit regions, evidence, and ATCs are also available through the checked
annotation forms described in [ANNOTATIONS.md](ANNOTATIONS.md). Explicit domains/results
remain necessary where neither bidirectional checking nor the partial annotation
pass below supplies them. Annotated function recursion is supported; general
`fix x. V` is not implemented.

Automatic closing of local refinement names at let boundaries remains in place;
its redesign is deferred. `closeLet`
projects names existentially in positive positions and dually in negative
positions, then verifies the generated contract by subtyping. This permits
ordinary local bindings without asking users to write every escape-free
annotation. The generated `Ascribe` is visible in elaboration. It is an
annotation-generation pass, not a replacement for the paper's escape conditions.

The selected backend is historical Lifted/Chez. Its runtime
evidence representation is useful for this implementation. Passing execution
tests establishes behavior of that path; it does not prove the Core-to-Lifted
translation correct.

## Named interface declarations: surface signature lookup

Native `interface File { def read(): Int def close(): Unit }` headers and
`with h: File { ... }` implementations are accepted. Parameterized interface
declarations/explicit instantiations and multiple value arguments are also
supported; each implementation still has monomorphic operation signatures.
The checker resolves declarations in the top-level environment and verifies any repeated implementation annotations
against them. Missing/extra/duplicate clauses and wrong arity are rejected.
An absent return clause expands to an identity clause with a fresh binder.
No nominal-interface rule or capability equality rule is added to the calculus;
the existing structural operation signatures and `A_Handle` checks remain.

Named capability parameters such as `(f: File) => T` and `fun (f: File)`
expand to the same structural signatures and capability abstraction rule.
An expected capability type supplies its complete answer contracts. In a
consumer parameter annotation without such an expectation, the enclosing
result annotation supplies `C => C` defaults; it must resolve before the
consumer's value/caller binders. This includes abstract computation parameters
and effectful computations. There is no call-site specialization or inferred
answer-contract quantification. A named abstraction without a sufficient
context is rejected. Core independently rejects unresolved interface names.

A result-only declaration does not specify an ATM answer transition. Each
implementation may give an explicit transition or use the contextual convention
below. This is additional surface elaboration, not a new inference rule in the
paper. [SYNTAX-DIFFERENCES.md](SYNTAX-DIFFERENCES.md) records the native language
features that remain unimplemented rather than attributing them to ATM.

## Native syntax elaboration

`Parser`/`Surface` lower nested expression calls to fresh `let` bindings in source
evaluation order. Computed or partial right operands of Boolean short circuit
operators stay under an `If`. Multiple parameters/arguments become nested pairs
and checked projections, with corresponding substitutions in result/answer
refinements. Native datatype/match spelling uses the existing datatype rules.
Ordinary self recursion selects the existing annotated `LetRec`; acyclic
top-level dependencies become local bindings. Native type-parameter/application
spelling uses the existing type abstraction/application machinery.

When `main` omits its result, the checker synthesizes the complete program and
retains the pure-final-computation, capability-escape and residual-obligation
checks. Native block/capture inference and native effect-set inference remain
unsupported; reusable helpers can use explicit polymorphic parameters below.
Empty handlers retain a region and distance-one edge; they are not optimized
away before checking. These conveniences do not change the evidence/ATC rules
or establish an operational correspondence theorem for the compiler.

## Reusable helpers: explicit polymorphism

[`file-reusable.effekt`](../../examples/atm/file-reusable.effekt) uses an
explicitly region/computation-polymorphic `file[R: Reg, C: Cty]` helper,
curried as `file[R][C](descriptor)(callback)`. Its ordinary domain is `Int`;
its result is a fixed-region callback consumer at the explicitly supplied `R`.
The fresh caller of the ordinary arrow cannot occur in this result.
Callbacks explicitly quantify over ATCs; the helper supplies `[]` when calling
at the newly installed handler. `interface File`, `read(): Int`, and
`close(): Unit` remain; the mock-backed program returns 42.

There is one checked helper/handler body, no per-call source rechecking or
specialization. `AtmExplicitFileTests` checks distinct computation instances,
runtime arguments, and invalid unused definitions and calls.

The November 12 claim that ordinary caller-indexed result families implement
Definition 17 was incorrect and is superseded by the November 13 repair.
`A_Abs` retains `(x: T) ->rho C` with a minimum call requirement and a codomain
independent of the fresh caller. Its region/distance/evidence quantifiers belong
to elaboration. Synthesis enforces `alpha notin fv(C)` and checking rejects
caller-dependent result annotations. [CALLER-INDEXED.md](CALLER-INDEXED.md)
explains the distinction and the explicit migration of Fig. 1.

Explicit call-ATC abstraction remains beyond the printed algorithm's
incompleteness boundary. Fixed-region contracts remain a declarative checking
bridge. Post-parameter region names are body aliases, with no permission to
bind the source result. Pre-parameter region quantification is explicit and
can occur in that result. The paper and its proof are unchanged.

## Audit of other additional mechanisms (2026-11-12)

The audit compared the ATM parser, checker, evidence/annotation machinery,
Core elaboration and lowering with `defn/algorithmic.ott` and
`PLDI27/sections/implementation.otex`. Searches for special-case names,
example constants, fallbacks and prototype paths found no remaining branch
that recognizes Fig. 1, `file`, or `File`. This is a scoped source review and
regression check, not a proof that the implementation has no bugs.

| Mechanism | Finding and disposition |
| --- | --- |
| Native block contextual specialization | Removed in full; explicit quantified helper replaces it. |
| `handlerResultValue` / `projectedValue`, and default operation `C => C` | Extra, partial annotation generation. Candidates still undergo full handler/clause checks; there is no retry under a weaker annotation. Retained for general surface convenience. The reusable Fig. 1 supplies these annotations explicitly. |
| `closeLet` refinement closing | Extra annotation generation, followed by escape and subtype checks. Retained and described above; not a printed inference rule. |
| `checkTermInMode` for ordinary handler returns | Explicit synthesis/subsumption reconciliation of the printed mode mismatch. Retained and disclosed below. Fig. 1's generic helper return has a pure expected answer. |
| Fixed-region contracts and `return effect` | Explicit declarative bridges retained with exact-region/contract checks. `local` syntax is removed. Curried Fig. 1 uses the fixed-region bridge for its returned callback consumer, but does not use `return effect`. |
| Named interfaces, zero arguments, expression sequencing, pairs, plain `fun`, prefixless arguments | General surface elaboration into checked forms. Retained; no example name or constant selects a typing path. |
| Symbolic-distance ATC inference | Still rejects. Explicit evidence and ATCs must satisfy their kinds, endpoints, depth and answer contracts. No fallback assigns distance zero or discards answer layers. |
| Scoped capability tails, answer sequences, `repeatable`/`after` bounds | Old prototype forms remain rejected by the checker. |
| ARM benchmark specializations/state passing | Source-level adaptations, not compiler branches. Kept with the disclosures in [BENCHMARKS.md](BENCHMARKS.md); not evidence of support for the original generic APIs. |

Pure sequencing now preserves the whole abstract computation form after a pure
binding, as in `A_Let`; tuple parameters can therefore precede an abstract `C`
result. No mock-specific relaxation is used. General native block scheme
inference and abstract ATC result projection remain separate limitations.

## Omitted handler annotations: additional surface inference

The 2026-11-10 Fig. 1 audit compared `Checker.scala` with the current
`defn/algorithmic.ott` and `PLDI27/sections/implementation.otex` in the paper
repository. The paper explicitly assumes operation signatures are supplied.
`A_Handle` checks against a complete computation type `C_F`; its inherited
mode is `pi(C_F)`. That mode alone does not determine the value result or the
initial answer. There is no handler-synthesis rule in the printed algorithm.

The result-only operation syntax therefore adds a surface convention: for a
known handler computation `C`, an omitted operation transition is `C => C`.
Each resulting clause is checked by the existing clause checker. This does not
infer arbitrary answer-type modification or make operation invocations pure.

An unannotated handler in synthesis now uses an additional, partial annotation
pass. `handlerResultValue`/`projectedValue` project a candidate value type `T`
from declared value types, operation result types, the handled body, and the
return clause, forgetting refinements. They do not produce a typing derivation.
The proposed whole-handler annotation is `T / pure` in empty inherited mode
and `T / (C => C)` under inherited answer `C`. Its final-answer projection
therefore matches the input mode. `inferHandler` then performs the full checks
on the original body and clauses, including operation arguments, evidence,
ATC depths, residuals, return contracts, and scope escape. No supplied annotation
is weakened or retried under a different type. Unsupported projections require
an explicit annotation; this is not principal or complete inference.

For the inlined Fig. 1 companion, this generates outer `Int / pure` and inner
`Int / (Int / pure => Int / pure)`. The operation annotations are completed
using those computations before `A_Do` reconstructs depth-zero or depth-one
contexts. `AtmHandlerInferenceTests` also checks a Bool-valued inner handler
under an Int answer, multiple nesting levels, and invalid arguments/clauses.

This is an implementation extension that feeds annotations to the existing
checker, not a claim that the paper already infers those annotations. The
separate return-clause mode bridge below remains relevant, and no mechanized
soundness theorem for these Scala passes is claimed.

## Handler return mode: an explicit rule reconciliation

The supplement's `A_HRet` checks the return body under empty inherited mode
against `C`. Its general `A_SubC` conclusion, however, checks under `pi(C)`.
For impure `C`, these are different modes. Merely renaming an implementation
function would not resolve that discrepancy.

The implementation retains empty inherited mode and uses this explicit bridge:

```
Gamma | delta | rho | empty |- M synthesizes D
Gamma |- D <: C
------------------------------------------------  return-clause bridge
check the return clause against C, retaining M's elaboration
```

For `return V`, value checking supplies the expected value type before producing
the pure computation `D`. This also permits an unannotated lambda in a return
clause. The final subsumption is checked in the return-clause context, not under
facts from the handled body's execution path.

The declarative justification is `T_Sub` after elaboration of `M`; a pure `D`
can meet an impure `C` only when `S_CPureImpure` establishes the required answer
subtyping premise. This is a proposed reconciliation of the printed mode rules,
not a claim that the printed algorithm already contains this bridge. The code
makes the choice explicit in `checkTermInMode`.

The explicit surface form `return effect x => { M }` now opts into checking `M`
against the known return computation `C` under `pi(C)`. This is a second,
deliberate declarative `T_HRet` bridge, not the printed `A_HRet` rule. The default
form remains unchanged. Checking is in the ambient region outside the handled
delimiter, with the returned-value assumption and outer capabilities only.
`return-effects.effekt` exercises an outer operation in this clause. Regressions
reject the wrong answer type and use of the exited handler's capability.

## Explicit fixed-region functions

`(T) =>[r] C` is an explicit declarative `T_Abs`/`T_App` contract. Ordinary
`fun` can check against it; `fun (x: T) at [r]: C { ... }` supplies the contract
inline. `local` is no longer syntax. `FixedFunction`/`FixedLambda` retain the
exact region and no abstract call evidence. Calls at another region and
implicit promotion to an ordinary arrow are rejected. Compatible resumptions
can still be stored under such a contract. The ARM ports retain this behavior.

Returned fixed arrows and evidence kinds may refer to regions already in
scope, including explicit region parameters. They cannot refer to an ordinary
arrow's fresh caller. See [CALLER-INDEXED.md](CALLER-INDEXED.md) for the
minimum-requirement arrow, ATC extension, and migration examples.

## Unresolved fidelity and coverage gaps

These omissions are not defended as better algorithms, and are not fixed by the
repairs above:

1. **Definition 17 is not implemented literally.** Core annotations still use
   the algorithmic `Function`, `Continuation` and `CapabilityPoly` constructors,
   alongside the explicit fixed-region `FixedFunction` extension.
   Function nodes retain elaborated caller region/distance binders; ordinary
   source types have no caller binder. Explicit ATC telescopes remain an
   extension, and types are not
   expanded into a separate declarative language containing the full
   `forall r:Reg. forall d:Dist. forall e:Ev[r <=_d rho]. ...` telescope.
   Capability abstraction also remains a surface convenience that binds both
   the region and a capability value. A complete target translation must make
   this elaboration explicit as well.
2. **Polymorphic operation-signature binders remain unsupported.** Explicit
   `Reg`, `Dist`, `Cty`, `Ev`, and `ATC` quantification/application are now checked,
   alongside existing type, predicate, effect and capability forms. This does
   not add quantifiers to individual operation clauses or implement every
   declarative computation rule for opaque effects.
3. **Abstract result projections have a backend restriction.** Direct Lifted
   lowering supports computation variables via value-type parameters, but an
   abstract ATC application used as a computation's result needs a known value
   projection. ATC applications in answer endpoints, including the symbolic
   callbacks, execute. The legacy source emitter rejects the new kind-polymorphic
   forms. See [ANNOTATIONS.md](ANNOTATIONS.md).
4. **Other language coverage remains limited.** General value fixpoints,
   polymorphic datatypes, and unknown refinement-predicate inference are absent.
   Monomorphic data now supports exhaustive matching, dependent fields, closed
   pure top-region function fields, and structurally recursive logical measures.
   The function component of logical data is projected to unit; executable
   equality on function-containing data is forbidden. This extension is not a
   mechanized general datatype theory or automatic induction procedure.
5. **All 52 pinned upstream ARM programs now have ports with adaptations.**
   Thirty-one accept and 21 fail their contracts; one accepted distribution file
   is mislabeled UNSAT upstream. BFS/modulus/shift helper specialization and
   scheduler/reference state passing are disclosed in [BENCHMARKS.md](BENCHMARKS.md).
   In particular, shift's inert recursive reset is omitted; the general recursive
   helper is not implemented. The 59 paper ARM rows remain a different inventory.
6. **No mechanized implementation or backend preservation proof is provided.**
   Regression tests and SMT validity checks are distinct from that proof.

The explicit annotation path now checks dependent kinds, scoped aliases,
evidence endpoints, distance equality, and ATC plugging. Core independently
checks kind applications and symbolic ATC depths; Lifted receives evidence
parameters as runtime arguments. Remaining target work includes the literal
Definition 17 translation and polymorphic operation signatures, with a complete
independent declarative checker.

Symbolic-distance ATC **inference** is a separate matter: rejecting it agrees
with supplemental Section 3.3, page 37. ATC abstraction was identified
there as future work. It is now available explicitly; the unannotated algorithm
and its symbolic-distance rejection remain unchanged.

## Validation

See [VALIDATION.md](VALIDATION.md) for commands, counts and logs. This work changes the ATM
frontend and validation, not the historical Lifted runtime. Documents describe
remaining work explicitly rather than counting it as implementation coverage.
