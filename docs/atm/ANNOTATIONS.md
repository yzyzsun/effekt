# Explicit ATM annotations

The ATM frontend accepts explicit regions, distances, evidence, computation
types, and answer-type contexts (ATCs). They are checked before elaboration;
unannotated ATC inference remains partial. Explicit call-ATC abstraction is
the extension described below. The entry point is
`effekt.atm.Main`, separately from native Effekt source checking.

## Binders and applications

`fun [R: Reg, D: Dist, E: Ev(R, D, h), K: ATC(D)] { value }`
introduces a left-to-right telescope. Each kind can refer to earlier parameters
and enclosing bindings. The corresponding type is written with nested
`forall R: Reg. (body)` quantifiers. Plain value-type parameters use `fun [A]`;
value parameters can follow directly, as in `fun [A](x: A): A { x }`.
Answer-effect parameters use `fun [E: Eff] { value }`, with the type
`forall E: Eff. (T)`. They share the bracket list with value types and other
kinded parameters, for example `fun [A, E: Eff, R: Reg](x: A): A { x }`.
Named definitions also accept these parameters. `Eff` denotes ATM answer
effects, not native Effekt effect sets. Bare arguments such as `f[pure]` and
`f[(Int => Bool)]` select the answer-effect grammar from the parameter's kind.

Capability values use ordinary parameter and application syntax:

```effekt
interface Ask { def ask(): Int }
def use(body: (c: Ask) => ((Unit) =>[c] Int / (Int => Int))) at [top]: Int = {
  try { body(h)() } with h: Ask { def ask() = resume(42) }: Int
}
def main(): Int = use(fun (c: Ask) {
  fun () at [c]: Int / (Int => Int) { c.ask() }
})
```

`c: Ask` takes the operation value signatures from the declaration. In a
consumer's parameter type, its result annotation `C` supplies the default
`C => C` operation answers. `C` can be a computation parameter or a computation
with an answer effect, as in the reusable file example. A trailing whole-body
computation ascription can supply the same context for an inferred function.
The result must resolve in the domain's lexical scope, before the consumer's
value, caller-region, or call-ATC binders.

When checking a named capability lambda or domain against an expected capability
type, the checker uses that type's full operation contracts, including distinct
answer endpoints. It checks the interface's operation names and value signatures
against those contracts. Parameterized names such as `Reader[Int]` work too;
ordinary type parameters and local type aliases can shadow an interface name.
Named references disappear during checking: Core still carries structural
signatures, capability regions, and explicit answer contracts. A standalone
named abstraction without a sufficient answer context is rejected; it does not
infer answers from future call sites. Structural contracts remain available
when an explicit answer transition is needed:

```effekt
val forward: (c: { def ask(): Int / (Int => Int); }) => cap(c) =
  fun (c: { def ask(): Int / (Int => Int); }) { c };
// Within a compatible handler h:
val saved = forward(h);
```

The structural parameter contract introduces an abstract capability region;
its name scopes over its own operation contracts and the result. The checker
retains capability subtyping, residual evidence bounds, and handler escape
checks. This elaborates to the existing capability abstraction/instantiation
rules, without adding a caller binder or handler delimiter. Its body remains a
value, commonly a returned function; computations belong in that function.
For example, `fun (c: { ... }) () at [c]: C { ... }` is the curried spelling of
`fun (c: { ... }) { fun () at [c]: C { ... } }`. Multiple capability arguments
can likewise use nested functions and chained calls `f(h)(k)`.

The older `typefun`, `capfun`, `effectfun`, `forall cap`, `forall effect`, and
brace capability applications remain parser aliases for archived source
compatibility. Maintained examples use `fun`, capability arrows and ordinary
calls. `predfun` is unchanged.

Arguments need no kind prefix: the next quantified parameter determines how
each argument is checked. Both grouped and chained brackets are accepted:

```effekt
callback[inner, 1, ev(inner), Int / (Int => [])]()
callback[inner][1][ev(inner)][Int / (Int => [])]()
```

These instantiate a `Reg`, a `Dist`, the corresponding `Ev`, and `ATC(1)` in
order. Names are resolved in their lexical scope; evidence endpoints and
context depths are still checked. `fun` and bare applications elaborate to
the same checked abstractions/applications as the older tagged forms.

| Kind | Argument syntax | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Eff` | `[pure]`, `[(Int => Bool)]` | An answer effect |
| `Reg` | `[top]`, `[h]`, `[R]` | A lexical region; `top` denotes the program's ambient region |
| `Dist` | `[1]`, `[D + 1]` | A nonnegative distance; sums are equal modulo associativity, commutativity, and zero |
| `Ev(R, D, S)` | `[E]` | Evidence from exactly `R` to `S`, at distance `D` |
| `ATC(D)` | `[K]`, `[Int / (Int => [])]` | An answer context with exactly `D` layers |
| `Cty` | `[Int / (Int => Bool)]` | A complete computation type, including its answer effect |

A bound computation variable can be written `C` in a computation-type position
(the older `cty C` spelling is also accepted). Plugging a computation into
an ATC is written `K[Int]` or `K[C]`. `(T) =>[R] C` selects an explicit call region
for a function type; ordinary `fun` can check against that contract. A callback
can declare its result as
`Int / (K[Int] => K[Bool])` and be instantiated at different handler depths.

## Evidence and contexts

An operation accepts evidence followed by an answer type context. Either
annotation may be omitted:

```effekt
h.ask[E; K]() // both annotations
h.ask[E]()    // evidence only, when E has kind Ev(...)
h.ask[K]()    // answer type context only, when K has kind ATC(...)
h.ask()      // reconstruct both
```

A single annotation name is classified by its kind in the current scope,
including kind parameters and lexical aliases. Its spelling does not determine
its meaning. Concrete expressions can also be used alone, for example
`h.ask[refl]()` or `h.ask[[]]()`. Omit the entire bracket when neither
annotation is supplied.
The older tagged form `h.ask[evidence E; atc K]()` remains accepted for archived
sources. General applications also accept the older prefixes (`region`,
`distance`, `evidence`, `atc`, `cty`, and `type`). Bare effect and predicate
arguments are selected by their quantified parameters in the same way.

The evidence's source must be the current region and its target must be the
receiver's region. The ATC's depth must equal the evidence distance. The checker
plugs the operation's initial and final answers into that context and checks the
result against any inherited answer. These are the current `A_DoAnn` and
`A_DoAnnF` rules, supported in both default and strict mode:

- Without an inherited answer, `A_DoAnn` synthesizes
  `T' / (y. K[C1]) => K[C2]` from the instantiated operation signature.
- With inherited answer `F`, `A_DoAnnF` checks `K[C2] <: F` and synthesizes
  `T' / (y. K[C1]) => F`. The subtype check need not be equality.

Both rules substitute the supplied type and value arguments before plugging
the answers into `K`. Evidence and type arguments are elaborated; the ATC is
retained as a checked Core certificate and erased during lowering. Symbolic
evidence and ATC parameters are supported without choosing a numeric distance.
For example, inside handler `h`, `def call() at [h] = { h.ask[refl; []]() }`
can synthesize an effectful result without a result annotation in strict mode.
If an annotation is omitted, its existing reconstruction procedure is used;
symbolic-depth ATC inference remains partial, and an operation without an ATC
still needs an inherited final answer.

Evidence consists of `refl` (or `refl(R)`), `ev(h)`, a bound evidence variable,
or composition `E + F`. `ev(h)` looks up the in-scope edge from handler `h` to
its parent, at distance 1. This lookup was previously spelled `step(h)`.
Composition checks the intermediate region, not just the total depth.
`path(h)` requests ordinary evidence reconstruction from the current region to
`h`; it retains any residual obligations. A distance numeral alone is never
evidence for crossing a handler.

Contexts consist of `[]`, a bound context, a layer `T / (C => K)`, or composition
`K[J]`. A dependent layer `(x: T) / (C => K)` binds `x` only in `C`. The alternative
`layer(T, C, K)` accepts complex value types without ambiguous parentheses.
Context application substitutes the entire computation, including nested answer
effects and refinement predicates.

Handler labels already name regions: in `try { ... } with h: ...`, use `h`
in region arguments, `Ev(h,0,h)`, `refl(h)`, or `at [h]`. Use `top` for the
closed program's ambient region. To refer to an ordinary function's caller,
explicitly bind a body alias: `fun (x: T)[R: Reg]: C { ... }` or
`def f(x: T)[R: Reg]: C = ...`. The alias is available inside the body and
subsequent call-ATC kinds, but cannot occur free in `C` or the ordinary domain
`T`. The same codomain restriction applies to `(T)[R: Reg] => C` annotations.
The resulting ordinary source arrow has no caller binder. Pre-parameter
`fun [R: Reg] ...` is explicit quantification and may occur in a returned type.
`here` has no predefined meaning. See [CALLER-INDEXED.md](CALLER-INDEXED.md)
for the `A_Abs` freshness condition and the updated Fig. 1.

Lexical aliases use `region R = h;`, `distance D = 1;`,
`evidence E = ev(inner);`, `atc K = Int / (Int => []);`, and `cty C = Int;`.
Aliases are resolved at their definition and preserve generative region identities.

## Execution and validation

- [`polymorphic-outer-call.effekt`](../../examples/atm/annotations/polymorphic-outer-call.effekt)
  supplies the symbolic callback's ATC at its call site; caller evidence is reconstructed.
- [`multiple-capabilities.effekt`](../../examples/atm/annotations/multiple-capabilities.effekt)
  keeps both capability parameters abstract and supplies their relative evidence.
- `AtmPolymorphicSyntaxTests` checks `fun` binders and bare arguments against
  the tagged program's Core, grouped/chained application, scoped aliases,
  legacy prefix words used as names, computation/effect/predicate arguments,
  dependent ATC scope, and rejection of invalid kinds, evidence, and depths.
- `AtmExplicitAnnotationTests` covers depths 0/1/2, composed symbolic contexts,
  computation polymorphism, dependent-layer scope, alpha-renaming, shadowing,
  invalid annotations, and independent Core certificate validation.

Run either example with
`sbt 'effektJVM/runMain effekt.atm.Main --run examples/atm/annotations/polymorphic-outer-call.effekt'`.
The tests compare the independent source interpreter with direct Chez-Lift,
with optimization both enabled and disabled. Evidence parameters become real
Lifted evidence arguments. Region, distance, and ATC parameters are erased;
computation parameters retain their value projection as a Lifted type parameter.

The legacy Effekt/JavaScript emitter rejects the new kind-polymorphic forms
explicitly. Direct Lifted lowering currently requires a known value projection
when an abstract ATC application occurs as the **result of a computation**, as
opposed to an answer endpoint. Such programs may check but report `Unsupported`
at lowering. This does not affect the annotated callbacks above. Polymorphic
operation-signature binders and a literal Definition 17 translation of implicit
function types remain separate work. Core rechecks scoped kinds, evidence, and
ATC certificates; it is not a second complete refinement checker or a preservation
proof.

## ATCs under the implicit caller telescope

`fun ()[R: Reg, K: ATC(dist(path(h)))]: C { ... }` names the caller `R`
and binds `K` inside the function's
implicit caller region, distance and evidence binders. `K` scopes over the
result and body, not the ordinary argument domain. Already-bound outer ATC
parameters can still appear in domains. Supply it at application
as `callback[[]]()` or `callback[layer(Int, Int, [])]()`, with the depth checked
against the actual call evidence. These functions are checked once; they are
not specialized. Explicit call-ATC abstraction extends the printed algorithm.
The [rule-boundary document](CALLER-INDEXED.md) distinguishes it from ordinary
minimum-requirement arrows and the declarative fixed-region bridge used by curried
Fig. 1. Ordinary domains and codomains cannot depend on the fresh caller region.
